# Movie Search

This project is a movie search application using Vaadin framework. It has been deployed with AWS
using Elastic-Beanstalk, where you can access it at:
http://moviesearch-env.eba-kpm4cyxm.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/

## Running the application locally
The project is a standard Maven project. To run it from the command line,
type `mvnw` (Windows), or `./mvnw` (Mac & Linux), then open
http://localhost:8080 in your browser.


## Deploying to Production
To create a production build, call `mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Windows),
or `./mvnw  clean package -Pproduction` (Mac & Linux).
This will build a JAR file with all the dependencies and front-end resources,
ready to be deployed. The file can be found in the `target` folder after the build completes.

Once the JAR file is built, you can run it using
`java -jar target/myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` (NOTE, replace 
`myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` with the name of your jar).
